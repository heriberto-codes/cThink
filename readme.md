## Description
When educating a diverse population of students, the ability to break down complex concepts becomes quite important. After working closely with The Knowledge House's students and his son Elijah 👶, Heriberto Roman, an Instructor at The Knowledge House, realized a consistent problem that existed with his adult students, elementary student [Elijah], and once himself as a code newbie: the problem of being inundated with new**,** difficult 💻 technical concepts and not being able to process and retain them 😧.

Heriberto set out to come up with a solution that could support code newbies and general learners 🙌.

cThink is a digital learning platform designed to improve retention of technical coding concepts through the Draw ✏️**,** Act 🎭**,** Build 🔧 {D.A.B} pedagogy and helps them retain complex coding concepts by associating them with personalized analogies, building them out, and saving their process.

It is centered on the abstraction component of the computational thinking model**,** which allows users to create a simplified representation of a problem that accommodates visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning styles.
