## Description
When educating a diverse population of students, the ability to break down complex concepts becomes quite important. After working closely with The Knowledge House’s students and his son Elijah 👶, Heriberto Roman, an Instructor at The Knowledge House, realized a consistent problem that existed with his adult students, elementry student [Elijah], and once himself as a code newbie: the problem of being inundated with new difficult, 💻 technical concepts and not being able to process and retain them 😧.

Heriberto set out to come up with a solution that can support code newbies across the nation 🙌.

cThink (computational thinking) 💭 is a progressive web app that focuses on the abstraction piece of the computational thinking model. This platform allows students to utilize the Draw ✏️,Act 🎭, Build 🔧 **{D.A.B}** pedagogy and helps them retain complex coding concepts by associating them with personalized analogies, building them out, and saving their process.
