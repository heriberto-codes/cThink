Make Coding Stick

## A Multisensory tool to improve retention of technical concepts

## What is cThink?
cThink is a multisensory learning tool that uses the D.A.B. method — Draw ✏️, Act 🎭, Build 🔧 — to help learners simplify technical concepts and retain them through association building.

Inspired by real classroom experiences and lessons with his young son Elijah 👶, former technical instructor Heriberto Roman set out to address a common challenge: learners at every age struggling to process and retain abstract programming ideas.

cThink answers that challenge by making the learning process visual, auditory, and kinesthetic — which accelerates understanding and boosts memory retention.

## How It Works
When introduced to a new coding concept, learners follow a 3-step process:

	1. ✏️ Draw it – Learners create visual representations of a concept, focusing on key parts rather than syntax. This simplifies complexity — a core abstraction skill.

	2. 🎭 Act it – Embodying or role-playing a technical idea forces learners to identify what matters most in a process. It encourages simplified, real-world analogies.

	3. 🔧 Build it – After conceptualizing and simplifying, students implement a solution — just like how abstraction leads into writing code or building models.

This approach taps into the brain’s hippocampus, which stores long-term memories by using context and repetition. Instead of memorizing code, learners develop personalized anchors — through creative rehearsal — that move knowledge from working memory into long-term memory.

## Why It Matters
	• 🚀 Boosts retention of abstract and difficult coding topics
	• 🧠 Supports all learning styles — visual, auditory, kinesthetic
	• 🧒 Great for both adult learners and younger students
	• 🎓 Built on the abstraction principle of computational thinking
