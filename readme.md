## What is cThink?
cThink is a multi-sensory learning tool that uses a learning assessment and the D.A.B. method — Draw, Act, Build — to help learners simplify technical concepts and retain them through association building.

Inspired by real classroom experiences and lessons with his young son Elijah, Software Engineer and technical instructor Heriberto Roman set out to address a common challenge: learners of all ages struggling to process and retain abstract concepts.

cThink tackles this challenge by making the learning process visual, auditory, and kinesthetic — accelerating understanding and boosting memory retention.

## How It Works
When introduced to a new technical concept, learners follow a 4-step process:

	1. 🧠 Assess it – learners complete a short, low-stakes 
	learning assessment that gauges their prior knowledge 
	and surfaces misconceptions. This helps tailor the D.A.B.   
	experience to their needs.

	Our learning assessment uses Bloom’s Taxonomy (Revised Version) 
	to quickly diagnose conceptual gaps and VARK-style prompts to 
	identify learning preferences — allowing us to tailor the 
	Draw, Act, Build experience to each user’s needs.

	⸻

	2. ✏️ Draw it
	By drawing what they understand, learners translate abstract technical 
	ideas into visual models that highlight key relationships, not syntax. 
	This process strengthens abstraction — a critical skill for problem-solving — 
	and helps shift complex concepts into long-term memory.

	⸻

	3. 🎭 Act it
	By acting out technical concepts, learners are pushed to prioritize 
	core steps and logic, rather than surface details. 
    Role-playing transforms abstract processes into concrete, 
	real-world analogies, activating kinesthetic memory and making 
	the learning experience more memorable and meaningful.

	⸻

	4. 🔧 Build it
	Once learners have visualized and acted out a concept, 
	they move into creation. By building something tangible — 
	like code, a prototype, or a process — they transform abstract 
	thinking into concrete output. This step reinforces transferable 
	problem-solving skills and mirrors how developers 
	turn mental models into functioning systems.


This structured, multi-sensory approach stimulates the hippocampus — the brain’s memory center — by layering context, active repetition, and engaging modalities like drawing, role-play, and building. Instead of leaning on rote memorization, learners create personalized mental anchors that promote deeper understanding and accelerate the transfer of knowledge into long-term memory.

## Why It Matters
	• 🚀 Boosts retention of abstract and difficult coding topics
	• 🧠 Supports all learning styles — visual, auditory, kinesthetic
	• 🧒 Great for both adult learners and younger students
	• 🎓 Built on the abstraction principle of computational thinking
