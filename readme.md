Make Coding Stick

## A Multisensory tool to improve retention of technical concepts

## What is cThink?
cThink is a multisensory learning tool that uses a learning assessment and the D.A.B. method — Draw ✏️, Act 🎭, Build 🔧 — to help learners simplify technical concepts and retain them through association building.

Inspired by real classroom experiences and lessons with his young son Elijah 👶, former technical instructor Heriberto Roman set out to address a common challenge: learners at every age struggling to process and retain abstract programming ideas.

cThink answers that challenge by making the learning process visual, auditory, and kinesthetic — which accelerates understanding and boosts memory retention.

## How It Works
When introduced to a new coding concept, learners follow a 4-step process:

	1. 🧠 Assess it – Learning Assessment
	Before diving in, learners complete a short, low-stakes. 
	assessment that gauges their prior knowledge and surfaces. 
	misconceptions. This helps tailor the D.A.B. experience. 
	to their needs.

	Our learning assessment uses Bloom’s Taxonomy (Revised Version) 
	to quickly diagnose conceptual gaps and VARK-style prompts to 
	identify learning preferences — allowing us to tailor the 
	Draw, Act, Build experience to each user’s needs.

	2. ✏️ Draw it
	Learners create visual representations of a concept, focusing. 
	on key parts rather than syntax. This simplifies complexity. 
	— a core abstraction skill.

	⸻

	3. 🎭 Act it
	Embodying or role-playing a technical idea forces learners 
	to identify what matters most in a process. It encourages 
	simplified, real-world analogies.

	⸻

	4. 🔧 Build it
	After conceptualizing and simplifying, students implement 
	a solution — just like how abstraction leads into writing 
	code or building models.

This step-by-step approach activates the brain’s hippocampus — the region responsible for long-term memory — by combining context, repetition, and multisensory engagement. Rather than relying on rote memorization, learners build personalized mental anchors that help transfer knowledge from short-term to long-term memory.

## Why It Matters
	• 🚀 Boosts retention of abstract and difficult coding topics
	• 🧠 Supports all learning styles — visual, auditory, kinesthetic
	• 🧒 Great for both adult learners and younger students
	• 🎓 Built on the abstraction principle of computational thinking
